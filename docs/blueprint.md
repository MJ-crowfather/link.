- Word Selection: Daily selection of a 5-letter target word from a pre-approved list. Words are never repeated.
- Initial Clue: Provides a preliminary one-word clue related to the chosen word's context at the beginning of each game.
- Guess Input: Allows users to input 5-letter word guesses.
- Link Generation: Uses a tool to generate a contextual link clue between the user's guess and the target word upon each guess. This link clue provides hints to help users arrive at the target word.
